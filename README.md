# Spotify Tracks
Literally, a repository filled with Spotify Track URLs, sourced from playlists, youtube, random searches and user submissions.

# Note
This repository will be updated now and then... when I do, it'll be around 1000+ tracks added each time.

# Discord Server
A read-only server, which posts a Spotify track every 4 hours *(option for other platforms is also displayed)*.
200+ tracks have been posted - also the latest music videos on YouTube get posted, every Friday/Saturday.

The best place to find new songs; from newly emerged artists to well known ones.
*All tracks are sourced from this repository.*

# Usefulness
I have created a very basic API for this, you have two options; [JSON](https://scholaralludelowdown.danielytuk.repl.co/) / [Embed](https://scholaralludelowdown.danielytuk.repl.co/embed).

 **JSON example**
 ```json
 {
	"date": "2013-03-13",
	"title": "Memoirs - Keeno Remix",
	"type": "track",
	"track": "Memoirs - Keeno Remix",
	"artist": "Rameses B",
	"image": "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2731a504a406aaa26bb1d428554",
	"audio": "https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/73a06fe756a3b264028d2f05020026a8c6e92773?cid=a46f5c5745a14fbf826186da8da5ecc3",
	"link": "https://open.spotify.com/track/5WKFvH9idAfnvr2VJbjmDH",
	"embed": "https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5WKFvH9idAfnvr2VJbjmDH"

## Disclaimer
Some tracks may be unavailable, due to region blocks/licensing.

# Support
I manually go through playlists, youtube, random searches and user submissions manually, with no help; you don't need to support, although it does help.
Alternatively, you can provide a linkback to either [this reposotory](https://github.com/danielytuk/spotify-tracks/), [my youtube](https://youtube.com/danielytuk), [twitter](https://twitter.com/danielytuk) or [Discord server](https://discord.gg/r3gmuYBtuX).
