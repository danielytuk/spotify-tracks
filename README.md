# Spotify Tracks

> A repository filled with Spotify Track URLs, sourced from playlists, youtube, random searches and user submissions.<br />(Mainly record label/distributor playlists)<br /><br />I will try to update this every week, but no promises.

## Discord Server

> A read-only server, which posts a Spotify track every 4 hours <I>(an option for other platforms is also displayed)</i>. 200+ tracks have been posted - also the latest music videos on YouTube get posted, every Friday/Saturday.<br/><br/>The best place to find new songs; from newly emerged artists to well-known ones.<br/><br/>
